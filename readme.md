# Maze solver and image library

This project is inspired by computerphile maze solving video.
Major differences: 
    * I'm using c++, instead of python
    * I'm writing my own image library instead of using an already existing one

Progress:
    * Library can read image data
    * Check if a given file is an image
    * Calculate the size of an image

ToDo:
    * un-compress the data so i can extract valuable data to build a maze

Purpose:
    * Seemed like a fun project
    * Reverse engineering a .png file using hexdump seemed interesting
